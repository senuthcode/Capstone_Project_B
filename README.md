# Capstone Project

This project aims to develop an AI-powered system that automates resume screening and expert finding. The system will use NLP techniques and LLMs to extract structured information from resumes, and deep learning models to rank candidates based on their skills and qualifications. It will evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics, and a web interface will be developed for user input.
